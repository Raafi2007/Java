What is a Class in Java?
A class in Java is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.

Think of a class like a recipe—it tells you how to make something, but it’s not the actual thing itself.
The actual object created from the class is like the cake that’s made using the recipe.
